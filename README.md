<p>The page is filled in after loading it using a js file, which pulls in data from the fil products.json. <br>
When you hover over an item from the "Our Products" section, you can add an item to the cart (the data is stored in localStorage), where you can increase or decrease the number of items with automatic price calculation.<br>
When you click on the "Clear cart" button, the cart is cleared and the card is closed
